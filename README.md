# Natural-Rubber-Price-prediction
Predicts the price of different types of processed natural rubber using decision tree regression in Python.

Regression tree is a supervised machine learning technique is used in the prediction of rubber price. Using many independent variables, we predict a dependent variable. Here, the dependent variable will be the price of rubber. Independent variables will be the currency exchange data, supply, import, export, production, crude oil prices and category of rubber. In the present work, regression tree algorithm is performed on price data of different forms of processed natural rubber and other dependent factors. Based on the input, an appropriate price prediction is made for the specified rubber type.
